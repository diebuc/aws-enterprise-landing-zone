```

### VPC Design Patterns

#### Shared Services VPC
- **Public Subnets**: NAT Gateways, Load Balancers
- **Private Subnets**: Shared services (DNS, Directory, Backup)
- **Transit Subnets**: Transit Gateway attachments
- **CIDR Range**: 10.0.0.0/16

#### Workload VPCs
- **Public Subnets**: Application Load Balancers, bastion hosts
- **Private Subnets**: Application servers, databases
- **Database Subnets**: Isolated database tier
- **CIDR Ranges**: 10.1.0.0/16, 10.2.0.0/16, etc.

#### Network Segmentation
- **Production isolation**: Complete network separation from non-production
- **Application boundaries**: Each application in separate VPC
- **Security groups**: Restrictive inbound/outbound rules
- **NACLs**: Additional layer of network-level security

## Security Architecture

### Identity and Access Management
```
